# High-Security Home Automation System - Security Model

## 🔒 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE

This document explains the **high-security authentication model** implemented for this home automation application.

---

## 🏠 System Overview

This is a **HIGH-SECURITY HOME AUTOMATION SYSTEM** where:

- ✅ Only **pre-authorized users** can access the system
- ✅ Face recognition is **mandatory** for authentication
- ✅ Email/Password 2FA is **optional** (configured in Settings)
- ❌ **NO public sign-up** or registration
- ❌ **NO unauthorized access** possible

---

## 🚫 What Was REMOVED

### **1. Sign Up / Registration Options**

#### ❌ **Removed from Login Screen:**
- "Don't have an account? Sign Up" link
- Any registration buttons or forms
- Navigate to register screen functionality

#### ❌ **Removed Routes:**
- `/register` route removed from app routes
- `ModernRegisterScreen` import removed

#### ❌ **Why Removed:**
**This is NOT a public app.** It's a private home automation system where only authorized household members should have access. Random people cannot "sign up" to access someone's home.

## 🔐 How Users Are Authorized

### **Option 1: Initial Setup (First User)**
When the app is first installed, the **primary user** must:
1. Set up Firebase Authentication externally (admin console)
2. Configure face recognition database
3. Add their face to the ESP32 camera system
4. Launch the app and authenticate

### **Option 2: Adding Family Members (From Settings)**
**Authorized users** who are already logged in can:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Authentication** section
2. Configure email/password credentials for Layer 2 (optional)
3. **Outside the app:** Admin adds new face to camera system
4. **Outside the app:** Admin creates Firebase user account
5. New user can now authenticate with face + (optionally) email/password

---

## 🛡️ Security Levels

### **Level 1: Face Recognition (Mandatory)**
- ✅ Primary biometric authentication
- ✅ Cannot be disabled
- ✅ Required for ALL users
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized access

### **Level 2: Email/Password (Optional)**
- ✅ Optional second factor
- ✅ Configured per-user in Settings
- ✅ Added security for sensitive operations
- ✅ Not a replacement for face auth

---

## 📋 What Users CAN Do

### ✅ **Login:**
- Authenticate with face recognition
- Optionally verify with email/password (if enabled)
- Access home automation controls

### ✅ **In Settings:**
- Enable/disable 2FA (email/password)
- Set email/password credentials for Layer 2
- Change appearance/language
- Configure MQTT/connection settings
- View profile
- Sign out

### ✅ **Control Home:**
- Manage devices
- Create automations
- Monitor energy
- Receive notifications

---

## 🚫 What Users CANNOT Do

### ❌ **Registration/Sign Up:**
- Cannot create new accounts from the app
- No "Sign Up" option exists anywhere
- No self-registration functionality

### ❌ **Unauthorized Access:**
- Cannot bypass face authentication
- Cannot access without pre-authorization
- Cannot add themselves to the system

---

## 🔧 User Management

### **How to Add New Users:**

**NOT from the app, but from:**

1. **Firebase Console:**
   - Admin creates new user account
   - Sets email and temporary password

2. **ESP32 Camera System:**
   - Admin enrolls new face in recognition database
   - Links face to user ID

3. **First Login:**
   - New user authenticates with face
   - System recognizes them
   - Access granted

### **How to Remove Users:**

1. **Firebase Console:**
   - Admin deletes user account

2. **ESP32 Camera System:**
   - Admin removes face from database

3. **Result:**
   - User can no longer authenticate
   - Access revoked immediately
