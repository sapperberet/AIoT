## Theme Pattern Applied

All updated screens now follow this consistent pattern:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final theme = Theme.of(context);
  final isDark = theme.brightness == Brightness.dark;
  final textColor = theme.colorScheme.onBackground;
  
  // Use these variables throughout:
  // - theme.scaffoldBackgroundColor for backgrounds
  // - textColor for all text
  // - textColor.withOpacity(0.6) for muted text
  // - Conditional gradients based on isDark
}
```

## Color Replacements Made

### Text Colors
- `AppTheme.lightText` → `textColor`
- `AppTheme.lightText.withOpacity(0.6)` → `textColor.withOpacity(0.6)`
- `AppTheme.mutedText` → `textColor.withOpacity(0.7)`

### Background Colors
- `AppTheme.darkBackground` → `theme.scaffoldBackgroundColor`
- `AppTheme.darkCard` → Conditional: `isDark ? AppTheme.darkCard : AppTheme.lightSurface`
- `AppTheme.cardGradient` → Conditional gradient based on `isDark`

### Border Colors
- `Colors.white.withOpacity(0.1)` → `isDark ? Colors.white.withOpacity(0.1) : Colors.black.withOpacity(0.1)`
- `AppTheme.lightText.withOpacity(0.1)` → `textColor.withOpacity(0.1)`
