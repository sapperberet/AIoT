# Authentication System Update

## üéØ Summary

The authentication system has been updated to make **Face Recognition** the primary login method, with **Email/Password** as an optional secondary authentication factor that is **disabled by default**.

## üìã Changes Made

### 1. Login Screen UI (`modern_login_screen.dart`)

**Before**:
- Email/Password form shown first
- Face recognition as secondary option at the bottom

**After**:
- **Face Recognition button** displayed prominently as the primary login method
- Email/Password form hidden by default
- Users can access Email/Password login under "Advanced Options"
- Clean, modern UI with glassmorphic design

### 2. Settings Provider (`settings_provider.dart`)

**New Settings Added**:
```dart
bool _enableEmailPasswordAuth = false;  // Default: OFF
String _userEmail = '';
String _userPassword = '';
```

**New Methods**:
- `toggleEmailPasswordAuth(bool value)` - Enable/disable email/password authentication
- `setEmailPasswordCredentials({String? email, String? password})` - Store credentials securely

**Firestore Integration**:
- All settings are automatically synced to Firestore
- Settings persist across devices
- Loaded on login, saved on change

### 3. Settings Screen (`settings_screen.dart`)

**New Section**: "Authentication"

Features:
- Toggle to enable/disable Email/Password authentication
- Email and password input fields (only shown when enabled)
- Informational messages explaining the authentication flow
- Security notice about credential storage

### 4. Documentation Updates

**FACE_AUTH_QUICK_START.md** updated with:
- Authentication overview
- New user flows (primary and alternative)
- Instructions for enabling email/password authentication
- Configuration guide

### 5. Version Control

**Added to `.gitignore`**:
```
# Backend folder
grad_project_backend-main/
```

## üîê Authentication Flow

### Primary Flow (Default)

```
1. User opens app
2. Login screen shows "Sign in with Face Recognition" as primary button
3. User taps face recognition button
4. System discovers beacon (2-5 seconds)
5. User looks at camera
6. Face verified ‚Üí User logged in
```

### Secondary Flow (Optional)

```
1. User opens app
2. User taps "Advanced Options"
3. User taps "Sign in with Email & Password"
4. Email/Password form appears
5. User enters credentials
6. User logged in
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Configuration

### For Users

1. **First Login**: Use face recognition (primary method)
2. **Enable Email/Password** (optional):
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Authentication
   - Toggle "Enable Email & Password" ON
   - Enter email and password
   - Credentials are saved securely to Firestore

3. **Next Login**: Choose either method
   - Face Recognition (always available)
   - Email/Password (if enabled)

## üîí Security

### Current Implementation

- **Face Recognition**: Primary authentication via local MQTT broker
- **Email/Password**: Stored in Firestore (encrypted in transit)
- **User Settings**: Synced across devices via Firestore
- **Default State**: Email/Password disabled (face-only authentication)

### Production Recommendations

For production deployment, consider:
- ‚úÖ MQTT TLS/SSL encryption
- ‚úÖ Firestore security rules
- ‚úÖ Password hashing before storage
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting on authentication attempts
- ‚úÖ Two-factor authentication combining both methods

## üì± User Experience

### Benefits

1. **Faster Login**: Face recognition is instant
2. **More Secure**: Biometric authentication by default
3. **Flexible**: Users can enable password backup if needed
4. **Seamless**: Settings sync across all user devices
5. **Privacy**: Email/Password only stored if user explicitly enables it

### User Journey

```
New User:
1. Install app
2. Register with face recognition
3. Login automatically with face
4. (Optional) Enable email/password in settings for backup

Returning User:
1. Open app
2. Face recognition login (instant)
3. Access home screen

User without face recognition:
1. Open app
2. Tap "Advanced Options"
3. Use email/password (if previously configured)
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Fresh Install**:
   - ‚úÖ Face recognition shown as primary option
   - ‚úÖ Email/password hidden initially
   - ‚úÖ Can access email/password via "Advanced Options"

2. **Settings Configuration**:
   - ‚úÖ Authentication section visible in settings
   - ‚úÖ Toggle enables/disables email/password
   - ‚úÖ Email/password fields only shown when enabled
   - ‚úÖ Settings saved to Firestore

3. **Login Flows**:
   - ‚úÖ Face recognition works as primary method
   - ‚úÖ Email/password accessible under advanced options
   - ‚úÖ Both methods navigate to home screen on success

4. **Settings Sync**:
   - ‚úÖ Settings saved on change
   - ‚úÖ Settings loaded on login
   - ‚úÖ Settings persist across devices

## üîÑ Migration

### For Existing Users

Existing users will experience:

1. **First launch after update**:
   - See new login screen with face recognition primary
   - Email/password auth is disabled by default
   
2. **To continue using email/password**:
   - Login once with face recognition (or via advanced options)
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Authentication
   - Enable "Email & Password"
   - Enter credentials

3. **Settings preserved**:
   - All other settings remain unchanged
   - Theme, language, notifications, etc. all preserved
