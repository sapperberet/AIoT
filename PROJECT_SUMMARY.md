## 🎯 Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Mobile Framework** | Flutter 3.0+ |
| **State Management** | Provider |
| **Authentication** | Firebase Auth |
| **Cloud Database** | Cloud Firestore |
| **Local Communication** | MQTT (mqtt_client) |
| **3D Graphics** | three.js (via WebView) |
| **IoT Devices** | ESP32 |
| **Languages** | Dart, JavaScript |

## 📋 Next Steps - Your Action Items

### 1. Install Flutter (if not already)
```bash
# Download from: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
flutter doctor
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd c:\Werk\AIoT
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Configure Firebase
- Create project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
- Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
- Create Firestore Database
- Download config files:
  - `google-services.json` → `android/app/`
  - `GoogleService-Info.plist` → `ios/Runner/`
- Update `lib/core/config/firebase_options.dart`

### 4. Set Up MQTT Broker
**Option A: Raspberry Pi**
```bash
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
```

**Option B: Cloud MQTT**
- Sign up at HiveMQ Cloud or CloudMQTT
- Get broker credentials

**Then**: Update `lib/core/config/mqtt_config.dart` with broker IP

### 5. Program Your ESP32
- See README.md for complete ESP32 code examples
- Configure WiFi credentials
- Set MQTT broker address
- Flash the code

### 6. Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

### 7. (Optional) Add Your 3D Home Model
- Export from CAD/SolidWorks as glTF
- Place in `assets/3d/home_model.glb`
- See `assets/3d/README.md` for detailed instructions

## 🚀 Quick Test Workflow

1. **Start the app**: `flutter run`
2. **Register**: Create a new account
3. **Check MQTT**: Look for WiFi icon in app bar (green = connected)
4. **Test alarm**: Use MQTT Explorer to publish test message:
   ```
   Topic: home/garage/fire_alarm
   Message: {"alarm":true,"severity":"critical","message":"Test alarm!"}
   ```
5. **View in 3D**: Navigate to "Home View" tab
6. **Check logs**: Navigate to "Logs" tab
