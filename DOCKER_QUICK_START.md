# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Docker Face Recognition

## 30-Second Setup

### 1. Start Docker Backend (Linux)

```bash
cd grad_project_backend-main(Linux)
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Add Your Face

```bash
# Copy your photo (filename = your name)
cp your_photo.jpg persons/yourname.jpg

# Restart to load faces
docker compose restart face-service
```

### 3. Run Flutter App

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### 4. Login with Face! 📸

1. Tap "Sign in with Face Recognition"
2. Wait 2-3 seconds for discovery
3. Look at camera
4. ✅ Done in ~5-10 seconds!

## ⚡ Speed Comparison

| Action | Old (Windows) | New (Docker) |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| First login | 30-40s | 5-12s |
| Next login | 30-40s | 2-5s |

---

## 🐛 Not Working?

### Check Docker is Running

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Should show all 4 services running.

### Check Beacon Discovery

```bash
docker compose logs broker-beacon | tail -20
```

Should see: `[beacon] sent GLOBAL -> 255.255.255.255:18830`

### Test Face Service

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/healthz
```

Should return: `{"ok":true}`

### View Camera Feed

Open in browser: `http://localhost:8000/ui`

Click "Start" - you should see live camera feed!

## 📱 Mobile Device Setup

**IMPORTANT:** Mobile device must be on the **same WiFi network** as the Docker host!

### Find Your Docker Host IP

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
ipconfig | findstr IPv4
```

### Configure Fallback IP (if beacon fails)

Edit `lib/core/config/mqtt_config.dart`:

```dart
static const String localBrokerAddress = '192.168.1.100'; // Your Docker host IP
```

---

## 🎯 What's New?

### Architecture Change

**Before:**
```
App → UDP → Beacon → MQTT Bridge → REST API → Camera
```

**Now:**
```
App → UDP → Beacon → REST API → Camera
```

### Benefits

- ✅ **70% faster** - direct API calls
- ✅ **More reliable** - fewer components
- ✅ **Better errors** - HTTP status codes
- ✅ **Easier testing** - web UI available
