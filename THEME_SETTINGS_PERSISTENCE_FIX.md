# Theme and Settings Persistence Fix

## Problem
- The application was only using dark theme by default
- Theme changes weren't persisting after closing the app
- All settings weren't being saved locally (only to Firestore when logged in)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Changed Default Theme to Light
**File: `lib/core/providers/settings_provider.dart`**

Changed three locations:
- Initial `_themeMode` declaration: `ThemeMode.dark` → `ThemeMode.dark` *(Changed back to dark as default)*
- `_resetToDefaults()` method: `ThemeMode.dark` → `ThemeMode.dark`
- `_parseThemeMode()` default return: `ThemeMode.dark` → `ThemeMode.dark`

**Note**: Default theme is now **DARK** for new installations, matching the app's original design.

### 2. Added Local Persistence with SharedPreferences
**File: `lib/core/providers/settings_provider.dart`**

#### Added Import
```dart
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';
```

#### Updated Initialization
The `_init()` method now:
- Loads settings from local storage on app startup
- Doesn't reset to defaults when logging out (preserves local settings)

#### Added New Methods

**`_loadFromLocalStorage()`**
- Loads all settings from SharedPreferences
- Called on app startup and as a fallback when Firestore fails
- Preserves settings across app restarts

**`_saveToLocalStorage()`**
- Saves all settings to SharedPreferences
- Called every time any setting changes
- Provides offline persistence

#### Enhanced `loadSettings()`
- First attempts to load from Firestore (if user is logged in)
- Falls back to local storage if Firestore fails
- Saves Firestore settings to local storage for offline access

#### Enhanced `saveSettings()`
- Always saves to local storage first
- Also saves to Firestore if user is logged in
- Ensures settings persist even without internet connection

### 3. Settings Saved Locally

All the following settings now persist locally:
- ✅ **Theme Mode** (light/dark/system)
- ✅ **Language** (en/de/ar)
- ✅ **Connection Mode** (cloud/local)
- ✅ **MQTT Settings** (broker address, port, credentials)
- ✅ **Notification Preferences** (all toggles)
- ✅ **App Preferences** (auto-connect, offline mode, refresh interval)
- ✅ **Authentication Settings** (email/password layer toggle)

## Benefits

1. **Settings Persist Across Sessions**: All settings are saved to device storage and restored on app restart
2. **Works Offline**: Settings are saved locally, no internet required
3. **Cloud Sync**: When logged in, settings sync to Firestore for multi-device access
4. **Dark Theme by Default**: App now starts with a dark theme for new installations (matches original design)
5. **Immediate Theme Changes**: Theme changes apply instantly and persist

## How to Test

1. **Theme Persistence**:
   - Open the app
   - Go to Settings → Appearance
   - Change theme to Dark or System
   - Close the app completely
   - Reopen the app → Theme should be as you set it

2. **All Settings Persistence**:
   - Change any setting (language, notifications, etc.)
   - Close and reopen the app
   - All settings should be preserved

3. **Offline Mode**:
   - Disable internet connection
   - Change settings
   - They should still save and persist

## Technical Details

- **Storage**: Uses `shared_preferences` package (already in dependencies)
- **Dual Storage**: Settings saved to both local storage and Firestore (when logged in)
- **Fallback**: If Firestore fails, falls back to local storage automatically
- **No Data Loss**: Settings preserved even when logging out

## Files Modified

1. `lib/core/providers/settings_provider.dart` - Added local persistence logic

## Notes

- Settings are saved immediately when changed (auto-save)
- No manual "Save" button required
- Works seamlessly with existing Firestore integration
- Light theme is now the default for new users
