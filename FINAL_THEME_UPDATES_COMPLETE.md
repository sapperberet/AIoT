## Theme Implementation Pattern

All screens now follow this consistent pattern:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final theme = Theme.of(context);
  final isDark = theme.brightness == Brightness.dark;
  final textColor = theme.colorScheme.onBackground;
  
  return Scaffold(
    backgroundColor: theme.scaffoldBackgroundColor,
    // ... rest of the UI
  );
}
```

### Color Replacement Strategy

| Old (Hardcoded) | New (Theme-Aware) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| `AppTheme.darkBackground` | `theme.scaffoldBackgroundColor` |
| `AppTheme.lightText` | `textColor` |
| `AppTheme.lightText.withOpacity(0.6)` | `textColor.withOpacity(0.6)` |
| `AppTheme.mutedText` | `textColor.withOpacity(0.7)` |
| `AppTheme.darkCard` | `isDark ? AppTheme.darkCard : AppTheme.lightSurface` |
| `AppTheme.cardGradient` | Conditional gradient based on `isDark` |
| `Colors.white.withOpacity(0.1)` | `isDark ? Colors.white.withOpacity(0.1) : Colors.black.withOpacity(0.1)` |
